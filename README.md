# [openSIS.Net](https://opensis.com/) - The next generation School Managemenet System

### Vision - Provide the ability to every school in this world to operate on-line.

### Goal - To create a global school management system suitable for any school, in any country. Build it as a single page application that will work for low bandwidth and no bandwidth users.

This repository will host the complete rewrite of the popular php version of the [openSIS](https://opensis.com) school management software. This version is being written in [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) with [Angular UI](https://angular.io/). The software is API based, database agnostic and multilingual.
